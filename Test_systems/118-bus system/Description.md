# Description 118-bus system
The IEEE 118-bus system is a widely used power flow and stability test case, representing a portion of the U.S. Midwest power grid. It consists of 118 buses, 19 generators, 54 loads, and 186 transmission lines, modeled on a 100 MVA base. The system includes a mix of high-voltage transmission lines, transformers, and reactive power compensation devices, making it useful for testing power flow algorithms, voltage stability, economic dispatch, and contingency analysis. With its larger size and complex topology, the IEEE 118-bus system provides a more realistic testbed for studying transmission network operations, optimization techniques, and system reliability, making it a key benchmark for power system research and education.
