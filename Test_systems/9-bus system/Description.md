# 9-bus System Description
The IEEE 9-bus system is a small but representative power system test case used for stability and power flow studies. It consists of 9 buses, 3 generators, 3 loads, and 9 transmission lines, typically modeled on a 100 MVA base. Buses 1, 2, and 3 are generator buses, while buses 4, 5, and 6 are load buses, with buses 7, 8, and 9 serving as intermediate connections. The system includes transmission line impedances, generator dynamic models with excitation and governor systems, and load power demands. It is widely used for power flow analysis, transient stability, small-signal stability, and voltage stability studies, making it a valuable benchmark for power system research and education.
