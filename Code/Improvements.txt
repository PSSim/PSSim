## Requiered Improvements: 
- Folders and subfolders need to be authomatic added to the path.

Solution:

Add the following lines of code to main.m file:

% Get the path of the currently running script or function
mainFolder = fileparts(mfilename('fullpath'));

% Add the main folder and all its subfolders to the MATLAB path
addpath(mainFolder);            % Add the main folder
addpath(genpath(mainFolder));   % Add all subfolders recursively
