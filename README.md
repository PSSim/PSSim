# PSSim: Power System Simulator

PSSim is a MATLAB-based power system dynamic simulator designed for research on power system dynamics and control :zap::technologist:. 

Includes:

:white_check_mark: Power flow analysis 

:white_check_mark: Time-domain RMS simulation  

:white_check_mark: Small-signal stability analysis.

PSSim is an educational tool for power system analysis, showcasing fundamental simulator structures, models, and practices from open-source and commercial software. It supports developing and testing new control and analysis solutions but is not meant to replace other simulators. Instead, it provides a simple, effective resource for students and educators to learn and teach key concepts.
